## FOSS4G:UK 2024: Call for Venues and Volunteers

After two successful FOSS4G:UK Local events in 2022 and 2023, and FOSS4G:UK Online in 2020, it’s time for us all to get together again in 2024 - for the first time since 2019 in Edinburgh. 

OSGeo:UK are calling for volunteers to help organise an event later this year, and for suggestions or offers of venues. We’ll need at least 6-8 people to organise everything (we already have a couple from the committee) - a few who are based in the venue location, but most can be remote. It will take a bit of time but anyone who has done it in the past will also tell you that it’s fun, rewarding and sociable in equal parts.

Some parameters/criteria for the event and venue:

- Well connected by public transport
- Able to hold 150 - 300 people
- Capacity of at least two separate rooms
- Facilities for on-site catering (either provided by venue or bought in)
- Streaming/recording facilities
- Good wifi
- Taking place over two days, dates TBC, but possibly October or November. 21st Nov is GIS Day and 22nd Nov is PostGIS day
- Access to accommodation a bonus 

If you think you can help in any way on any front, or just have ideas or comments, please fill in this quick form now: [https://forms.gle/782n58jc3cjdZfSA6](https://forms.gle/782n58jc3cjdZfSA6). We’ll be reviewing the responses on (or soon after) 31st March and we will make a decision on whether we can go ahead. Look forward to hearing from you, and seeing you in November!


### Dates to avoid / be aware of:

- GIS Day is 20th November, PostGIS Day is 21st November - we are considering this as an option.
