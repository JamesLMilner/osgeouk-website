- **How to register your Open Source Geospatial project as an OSGeo Community Project**
	- Registering your project as an OSGeo Community project is a great way of saying that your project is open source, and open to contributors. Nick Bearman will outline the process, and be on hand to help different projects register. The key elements to be an OSGeo Community Project are:
		- Be geospatial
		- Have a free license or an open source license.
		- Welcome participation and new contributors.
	- More info at [OSGeo Incubation Committee](https://www.osgeo.org/about/committees/incubation/) and [OSGeo Community Projects](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeo_Community_Projects).
	
- **OGC API standards, in particular Environmental Data Retrieval, and CoverageJSON **
    - A QGIS Plugin to support access to servers using the OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval (EDR) standard, with one of the outputs formats being CoverageJSON - not currently supported directly in QGIS. Useful to add?
    - [OGC API - EDR](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/edr/)
	- [QGIS Plugin](https://github.com/MetOffice/qgis-plugin-edr)
