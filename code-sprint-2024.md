### UK Code Sprint

We will be running our first UK code sprint this summer and I've got it pencilled in for Tuesday the 30th of July at the Weymouth Pavilion, Dorset. We are making a special effort to ensure that this event is going to be fun as well as useful and informative so we have deliberately picked a beautiful venue with view over Weymouth beach in the summer so that people can enjoy amazing Dorset coastline as they code. We also hope this will make it more accessible to those attending a university. 

To help us plan the event and confirm the booking I'd be grateful if you could let me know if you would be interested in attending by filling out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5lENX6KpoRwv3sYrSYDVQCr-ruCSPHvhMJ8ChSApdiQ-CmA/viewform). 

Attendance will be free of charge but there may be additional optional costs for activities and lunch depending on whether or not I can find a sponsor. 

At present we have two groups running a sprint on the day GIFramework Maps ([GitHub - Dorset-Council-UK/GIFramework-Maps: A .NET based web map built with OpenLayers and Bootstrap](https://github.com/Dorset-Council-UK/GIFramework-Maps)) and Terra-Draw ([GitHub - JamesLMilner/terra-draw: A library for drawing on maps that supports Mapbox, MapLibre, Google Maps, OpenLayers and Leaflet out the box](https://github.com/JamesLMilner/terra-draw)). If you would like to help us run one for other projects please also reply to this form! 

My goal is that new developers should be able to clone and get up and running on as many of these projects as possible this year so please factor in a stream for helping newbies get started!
