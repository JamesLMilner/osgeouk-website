### GoFundGeo & AGM 2023

OSGeo:UK [AGM](https://uk.osgeo.org/agm/agm2023.html) will take place on Mon 20th Nov 2024, 12pm - 1pm (GMT, UK/London) online using Zoom. We hope to see you there.

We will also discuss how we want to use the £6000 of funding to support open source geospatial software development. We've decided to call this '[GoFundGeo](gofundgeo.html)' and we are running the process similar to last year, where we supported 5 projects with a total of £3,878.52. Check out the link for details including how to apply, and join our [mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/uk) for details of the projects that apply.

### FOSS4G:UK Local 2023

[FOSS4G:UK Local 2023](foss4guklocal2023/index.html) went really well. It was held on Thurs 7th Sept, and we reached about 250 people across eight venues in two countries. We raised about £5000 for OSGeo:UK which will go towards our funding of Open Source Geospatial software over the coming year. The full programme is available in [PDF](foss4guklocal2023/2023_MAIN_Agenda - Google Sheets.pdf){:target="_newpage"} or [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ewkqvMZqXIwDtyEtCxdKte7czpZxUjqqlCZkY1REmzc/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_newpage"}. See individual [venue pages](foss4guklocal2023/index.html#venues) pages for more details. 

We have done a short [write up](foss4guklocal2023/lessons-learned.html), summarising some of the feedback and highlighting a few of the lessons learned for next time. We’re planning to run a conference in 2024, and will be asking for volunteers early next year - so please sign up to the [mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/uk) or email <span class="osgeoemail"></span> to find out when we’ll be meeting to discuss this.

### Funding

From time to time we may choose to financially support an open source GIS project, or help someone attend an event. See [funding guidelines](fundingguidelines.html){:target="_newpage"} for more details on how to apply.

[GoFundGeo](gofundgeo.html){:target="_newpage"} annually funds a range of Open Source Geospatial software projects that will have an impact in the UK. Each year we use the surplus from our FOSS4G:UK conferences to fund relevant projects in the range of £500 - £1000 each. We also occasionally make ad-hoc donations to revelant projects, see [past donations](pastdonations.html){:target="_newpage"} for yearly breakdowns on the projects we have supported to date.
